# Calculator

Let me introducing you this simple calculator program developed with java.swing!

### Getting Started
The main function is under the file ```CalculatorLayout.java```, simply open it and run, the GUI window will immediately pop up.

If you like to have a quick look, simply open the file ```CalculatorJava.jar``` and have a glance. Everything should be setted up in that file.

### Calculator 1.0
- Until now, you can do basic calculation with this user interface.
- Make sure to click ```Enter``` after entering a number
- you can only use integers to do calculations
- the trigonometry functions are still unavailable

### Developing funcitons
- [ ] ```sin```, ```cos```, and ```tan``` functions (already added implementations -> empty Jbuttons)
- [ ] does not need to click ```enter``` everytime when entering a number
- [ ] able to input fractions and common constants like $$\pi$$

#### This project is still developing, so you may meet errors while running :)
